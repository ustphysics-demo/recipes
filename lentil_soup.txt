Lentil Soup - Recipe from Veronica Grieneisen

2  	Chopped onions
2 	Sliced carrots
3 	Sliced celery-sticks
1 	Peeled; cubed eggplant
1  	little red pepper (up to)
6  	Cloves garlic; minced
6 cup 	Stock (I use vegetable stock, here called "groenten broillon")
2 cup 	Lentils
2 	Chopped tomatos (I actually used canned tomatos)
1 	sack  Dried apricots; sliced (that gives the soup a somewhat sweet taste)
1  	Cinnamon stick

And then put the spices that you like, I used
2 teaspoon 	Komijnzaad gemalen (cumin seeds)
1½ teaspoon 	Salt

and in the end, you can sprinkle it with
Mint
Lime (juice)


Saute onion, carrots, celery, eggplant, cinnamon stick and garlic in oil until lightly browned. Add remaining ingredients except parsley and mint and simmer until lentils are tender. Add mint, spices and lemon to the end.
(oh yes, I actually put the soup through the blender so it become homogeneous - but I'm not sure it it looks that nice that way, so if you don't have a blender don't worry ;) )
